Group variables are used when you want to set variables at group level.

Note: Before running command for group variables don't forget to comment content in dev.testlab.com.yaml inside host_vars.

Run : ansible-playbook -i ~/Documents⁩/⁨ansible⁩/⁨Inventory/hosts.yaml ⁩~/Documents⁩/⁨ansible⁩/Playbooks/CommandModule.yaml

Then go to dev instance and check file is created or not in Documents folder.
