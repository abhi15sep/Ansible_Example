Idempotency : In ansible terms, If you run a playbook multiple times, you will always achieve the same state. You will not have 2 different states by running same playbook.
              This is necessary to have consistent state in your environment.


Configuration drift: Servers in infra becomes more and more different as times goes.

Module should be idempotent. i.e running a module multiple timesin sequence should have same effect as running it just once.

In last example "creates" key helped to made module idempotent.
