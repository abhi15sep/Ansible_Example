Things to know when working with variables:

hash_behaviour inside /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg default value is replace.
It means whenver any overlap will be seen it will replace the value. Its done according to order of precedence.

If two groups are at same level, the you can use ansible_group_Priority to give priority. i.e (ansible_group_Priority:10).
