1. sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

a) If in /etc/ansible/hosts file we want to add many hosts to a group like:

[dev]
dev1.testlab.com
dev2.testlab.com
dev3.testlab.com
dev4.testlab.com

But it can be done easily with:

[dev]
dev[1-4].testlab.com

This pattern also takes alphabets example dev[a-c].testlab.com

b) If your company is running ssh over not default port(i.e 22), then you can define non default port as:

[prod]
prod.testlab.com:2200

c) If assume on dev box ansible master is running and on the same machine one application is running, which you want to manage through ansible.

[dev]
dev.testlab.com ansible_connection=local

d) You can assign host variables to each host in inventory file. Lets assume on dev box apache is running on port 80 and on prod box apache is running on port 8080

[dev]
dev.testlab.com http_port=80

[prod]
prod.testlab.com http_port=8080

Might be you want to asssign variables to a group instead of a host, to achieve this (Group variables):

[dev:vars]
proxy_server=devproxy.testlab.com

[prod:vars]
proxy_server=prod.testlab.com

e) Super Groups: Super group contains multiple groups

[dev]
dev.testlab.com

[test]
test1.testlab.com

[staging]
staging.testlab.com

[prod]
prod.testlab.com

If you want to create 2 super groups, one with dev and test and other with staging and prod.

[lower_env:children]
dev
test

[upper_env:children]
staging
prod

To assign variables to super group:

[lower_env:vars]
ftp_server=10.0.10

[upper_env:vars]
ftp_server=192.168.1.1


f) By default there are 2 variables are there in inventory files: i.e all and ungrouped. Every host atlease belongs to 2 groups.

g) You do not need to store your inventory in default location i.e /etc/ansible/hosts.
